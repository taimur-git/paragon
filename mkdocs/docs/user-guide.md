## Core concepts

![img](img/manual/2.png)

To begin with, we kept the type of user very flexible. A user is free to use the site services as per his likings. Therefore, there are three possible ways that a user might interact with the site. First of all, a user can simply join course(s) and attend classes. Secondly, a user may post advertisements that he would like to teach others. Then conduct classes as per his schedule. Finally, there can be users who wants to teach others and at the same time enroll in courses posted by other users.

## Joining a course
