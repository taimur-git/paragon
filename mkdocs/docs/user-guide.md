User manual:
1. Getting started
Entering the site for the first time you can search for ads. Also, you can view all the ads posted by signed up users. You will be limited to only viewing this ads. In order to actually join one you need to register.
On the top right corner, click on the register button to view the step wise registration form. At first, we ask how you intend to use the site; maybe you want to teach others or you are looking for a tutor that fits your academic demands etc. As you proceed to the next steps, depending on your usability preference either one or two more steps are to be completed. For a quick registration, just choose the student option then provide some basic information(like your name, email address  and password) to get started in your Paragone journey!
2. Core concepts
To begin with, we kept the type of user very flexible. A user is free to use the site services as per his likings. Therefore, there are three possible ways that a user might interact with the site. First of all, a user can simply join course(s) and attend classes. Secondly, a user may post advertisements that he would like to teach others. Then conduct classes as per his schedule. Finally, there can be users who wants to teach others and at the same time enroll in courses posted by other users.
3. Joining a course
As a registered user, you can send join request to the ad posts viewed in the home page.
