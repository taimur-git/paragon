## Tech Stack

We used SvelteKit for our project, which is a modern Javascript framework. It uses Svelte as the front end and NodeJS on the backend, with a powerful routing system that is similar to NextJS.

For front end libraries, we used SkeletonUI, which is a TailwindCSS component library for Svelte.

For the database connection, we use Prisma as an ORM and Prisma Studio as a database viewer and editor. We used SQLite as our database but if needed we could change the connector to something different.

For testing, we used Vitest, as SvelteKit is a Vite project by default.

We used VSCode to develop our project, using extensions of Svelte, Prisma, TailwindCSS and Copilot.
