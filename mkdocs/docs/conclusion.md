# Conclusion

Working on this project was fun, since we had hands-on experience with SvelteKit. However, we did not plan things ahead of time which delayed our progress significantly.

Due to this, we were not able to add every single feature we promised to add, and here are the following omitted features:

* Searching by location
* Getting user location through geolocation API and storing it securely
* Allowing for batch studying
* Allowing for validating and verifying credentials
* Allowing for teachers to sign up with LinkedIn to easily fetch credentials
* An admin view to verify credentials against their proofs

While a lot of these already exist in the database, no implementations exist.

We definitely have a lot of future work ahead if we want to have this deployment ready, and there's a lot more beta testing to be done to finetune our project to allow it to be user-friendly.
